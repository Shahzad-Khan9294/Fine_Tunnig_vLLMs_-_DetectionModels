# Fine-Tuning Vision LLMs and Detection Models
Fine-tuning models such as EfficientNet, ConvNeXt Tiny, YOLOv5, NanoDet, RTDETR, or vision LLMs is a sensitive and critical task. Proper techniques ensure the model generalizes well without overfitting.

## 1. Model Understanding
- Architecture Awareness: Know the backbone (CNN, Transformer, hybrid) and task-specific head (classification, detection, segmentation).
- Pre-trained Knowledge: Assess which layers have learned generic features vs task-specific features.

## 2. Layer Freezing & Unfreezing
- Freezing Layers: Prevents updates to initial layers that capture low-level features (edges, textures).
- Unfreezing Layers: Gradually unfreeze deeper layers to adapt the model to your dataset.
- Selective Freezing: For specific tasks, some layers like BatchNorm may require unfreezing for proper statistics updates.

## 3. Data Understanding
- Class Labels: Check for class imbalance and label quality.
- Data Type & Distribution: Imagesâ€™ resolution, lighting, and variations.
- Large vs Small Datasets: Large datasets allow deeper fine-tuning; small datasets require careful regularization or data augmentation.

## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Learning rate scheduling, optimizer choice (AdamW, SGD), weight decay, batch size, and gradient clipping.
- For vLLMs, prompt tuning or adapter layers may also be considered.

## 5. Adding Layers
- Before Dense Layers: Additional convolutional or attention layers can improve feature extraction.
- After Input Layers: Preprocessing layers or normalization layers may be added for task-specific adaptation.

## 6. Normalization and Regularization
- Batch Normalization Layers: Fine-tuning may require unfreezing BN layers to adjust to new data distribution.
- Dropout and Regularization: Helps prevent overfitting during fine-tuning.

## 7. Task-Specific Considerations
- Detection Models (YOLOv5, RTDETR, NanoDet):
- Anchor box configuration and multi-scale feature maps adjustment.
- Augmentation strategies for object sizes, rotations, occlusions.
- Classification Models (EfficientNet, ConvNeXt):
- Output layer modification to match number of classes.
- Loss function adjustment (cross-entropy, focal loss).

## 8. Evaluation & Iterative Refinement
- Monitor training vs validation loss, accuracy, mAP (for detection).
- Early stopping and checkpointing to prevent overfitting.
- Test on realistic scenarios to ensure generalization.

# 9. Vision LLM (vLLM) Fine-Tuning Specifics
- Multimodal Input Handling: Ensure correct tokenization for image + text inputs.
- Adapter or LoRA Layers: Lightweight layers added for task-specific fine-tuning without full model retraining.
- Prompt Engineering for Vision LLMs: Adjust textual prompts during training to guide output generation.
- Memory & Compute Considerations: vLLMs are large; gradient checkpointing and mixed precision (FP16/BF16) are recommended.
